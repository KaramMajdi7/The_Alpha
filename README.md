# The_Alpha

This project was created using Python and the Kivy library, the idea of this game is: it's a spaceship trying 
to stay at the path created to get the highest score possible, and the path is changed every time, and the game 
took a lot of mathematical equations more than the logic or the python code, because it's an x-axis and 
y-axis and it has a spaceshp moving along, and so many equations had to be calculated to finish and to result with
this beautiful game.

And here is a couple of pictures for the game:(PS*the game has sound at the start, during and at the game over parts):
